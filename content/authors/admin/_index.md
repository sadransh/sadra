**Welcome to My Personal Page  :wave:**

My name is Sadra, and I am a Doctoral Candidate in Electrical Engineering focused on applied AI/ML research at RICS Lab. Currently, my work is focused on Computer Vision and Deep Learning for industrial systems. I am interested in putting state-of-the-art research from academia into practice and enabling industry with AI. Before joining RICS Lab, I worked on bionic robots, ML optimization algorithms, and designing embedded systems to control robots at FUM Advanced Robotics Lab. 

I spent a fantastic internship at Truveta from January to April 2022.
