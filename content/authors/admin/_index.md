**Welcome! :wave:**


My name is Sadra.

I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Truveta.

With a passion for research and innovation, my work revolves around natural language processing and generative AI to tackle intricate healthcare data challenges and ultimately make a difference in saving lives through data-driven solutions. Prior to my role at Truveta, I embarked on an enriching academic journey, earning a doctorate in Electrical Engineering. Throughout my doctoral studies, I specialized in Applied Machine Learning research, focussing on developing practical industrial AI solutions.
